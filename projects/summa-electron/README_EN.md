## Key Features

### Real-time Speech Recognition
- **Whisper MLX**: Apple Silicon optimized speech recognition
- **Dynamic Model Switching**: Runtime Whisper model selection
- **Audio Input Selection**: Various microphone device support

### Meeting Minutes Generation
- **AI-based Summarization**: Automatic summarization via Azure OpenAI
- **Prompt Customization**: Custom prompts and keywords
- **Real-time Transcription**: Instant speech content display

### Performance Optimization
- **Redis Cache**: Session data caching
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient resource management
- **Process Separation**: Independent Python server execution
