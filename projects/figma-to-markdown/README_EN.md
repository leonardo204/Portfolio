## Overview

**Figma to Markdown** is a Figma plugin that leverages AI to automatically convert Figma design frames into Confluence-compatible Markdown documentation. By automating design specification documentation, it significantly improves collaboration efficiency between developers and designers.

---

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Document Conversion
- Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Claude, Azure OpenAI, Ollama)
- Intelligent analysis of Figma frame structures to generate Markdown

### Multi-Frame Processing
- Sequential processing of multiple frames into a unified document
- Option for independent document generation per frame

### Automatic Mermaid Diagram Generation
- Automatic flowchart generation by analyzing design flows
- Support for process diagrams and sequence diagrams

### Multilingual Support
- 6 languages supported: English, Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, French, German
- Selectable document output language

### Rate Limiting Management
- Automatic API limit detection and retry logic
- Stable bulk processing support

### Token Usage Tracking
- Real-time token usage monitoring per frame
- Overall cost management features

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Figma Frame Structure Analysis
**Challenge**: Needed to accurately parse Figma's complex layer structure and component instances into a documentable format.

**Solution**: Implemented recursive traversal of Figma Plugin API's node tree to extract hierarchical structure, with custom processing logic for each component type.

### 2. Multi-LLM Provider Integration
**Challenge**: Had to handle various API formats and response structures from OpenAI, Claude, Azure, and Ollama through a unified interface.

**Solution**: Applied the Provider pattern to abstract each LLM's characteristics and designed a common interface for consistent API calls.

### 3. Rate Limiting and Bulk Processing
**Challenge**: Encountered API rate limit issues when continuously processing multiple frames.

**Solution**: Implemented exponential backoff retry logic and a request queuing system to enable stable bulk processing.
